# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Predicting Heart disease using different Supervised Learning Models to find out whether the model is equally good at predicting having heart disease (positive) and not having heart disease (negative) cases correctly.

The data has collected on health profile parameters of people showing symptoms of heart disease and their diagnostic results are given in the Heart_Disease_Data file. The list of health profile features on which data is collected are given below:

4	       RestBP	            Resting blood pressure
5	       Cholesterol      	Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6	       FBP	              Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7	       RestECG          	Resting electrocardiographic results 
8	       Max_HR           	Maximum heart rate achieved
9	       ExAngina         	Exercise-induced angina
10	     Oldpeak	          ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11	     Slope	            The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
